# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker 🐳🚀

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker** to automatically build, test, and manage a containerized Flask application.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python (Flask)
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions
- 🧪 Basic Testing (pytest)
- 📁 Makefile for simplified commands

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- ✅ Dockerized Flask app
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker build
- ✅ Automated testing
- ✅ Linting support
- ✅ Version-controlled commits (30+ commits simulating real DevOps workflows)

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)

The `ci.yml` file in `.github/workflows/` triggers on:

- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main`

Workflow steps:

1. **Checkout code**
2. **Build Docker image**
3. **Run lint/test commands**
4. (Optional) Push to container registry or deploy
